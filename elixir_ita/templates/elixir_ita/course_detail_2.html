			<p align="justify">
			    This course is aimed at PhD students and post-doctoral researchers who are applying or planning 
			    to apply high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies and related bioinformatics methods in their 
			    research. The aim of this course is to familiarise the participants with data analysis methodologies 
			    and provide hands-on training on the latest analytical approaches 

			   <p>Lectures will give insight into how biological knowledge can be generated from RNA-seq experiments 
			    and illustrate different ways of analysing such data. Practicals will consist of computer exercises 
			    that will enable the participants to apply statistical methods to the analysis of RNA-seq data under 
			    the guidance of the lecturers and teaching assistants. Participants with no UNIX/Linux experience will 
			    be provided with basic understanding of the command-line operations on the first day of the course.</p> 

			    <p>The course covers data analysis of RNA-Seq experiments. Topics will include: alignment, data handling 
			    and visualisation,region identification, differential expression, data quality assessment and statistical analysis.
