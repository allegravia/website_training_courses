[{"fields": {"code": "RNASeq2015", "title": "Gene Expression profiling with HTS: RNA-Seq data analysis", "text": "The aim of this course is to familiarize the participants with the primary analysis of datasets generated through the RNA-Seq assays. This course starts with a brief introduction to high-throughput sequencing (hts) technologies and their application to gene expression analysis (RNA-Seq). Next, we will present key steps in the data analysis pipeline (such as quality control, alignment, summarization) along with most commonly used software to accomplish them. Finally, we focus on dataset specific downstream analysis, including quantification of expression, transcriptome assembly and differential expression analysis.
