The aim of this course is to familiarise the participants with data analysis methodologies and provide hands-on training on the latest analytical approaches \r\n\r\nLectures will give insight into how biological knowledge can be generated from RNA-seq experiments and illustrate different ways of analysing such data. Practicals will consist of computer exercises that will enable the participants to apply statistical methods to the analysis of RNA-seq data under the guidance of the lecturers and teaching assistants. Participants with no UNIX/Linux experience will be provided with basic understanding of the command-line operations on the first day of the course. \r\n\r\nThe course covers data analysis of RNA-Seq experiments.\r\nTopics will include: alignment, data handling and visualisation, region identification, differential expression, data quality assessment and statistical analysis", "author": 1, "venue": "CINECA, Rome, Italy", "created_date": "2015-09-03T15:51:38Z", "data": "19-22 October 2015"}, "model": "elixir_ita.course", "pk": 1}, {"fields": {"published_date": "2015-09-05T16:11:35Z", "title": "NGS for evolutionary biologists: from basic scripting to variant calling", "text": "This course is about HTS data analysis.
